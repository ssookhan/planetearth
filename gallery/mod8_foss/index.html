                data-description="Trilobites are an extinct arthropod that were extremely successful throughout the Paleozoic. Trilobites are named after the three longitudinal lobes (tri-lobe) that characterize their body plan. Like many arthropods, trilobites moulted regularly by breaking upen it's exoskeleton in the head region. Most trilobite fossils are therefore only the moulted tail, which stays whole throughout the moulting process."

                data-description="Brachiopods were hugely successful in the Ordovician, and are thus an important and common fossil in southern Ontario. Unlike pelecypods, brachiopods have two shells with different sizes and are thus somewhat assymmetrical when viewed from the side, and they also tend to be less fragile than many pelecypod fossils."

In fact the Devonian is known as 'the age of fish' for the incredible diversity of fish body plans that emerged during this period. Most fish are too delicate to fossilize under ordinary circumstances, and the most common fish fossils found are placoderm plates, which are a rigid armour-like covering on some Devonian fish, and teeth."

Crinoids are delicate organisms with a long stem and arms made out of thousands of circular plates stacked upon each other. Crinoid stems often disarticulate (break up) into isolated cheerio-like plates, sometimes with a star-shaped hold caused by the pentaradial symmetry for which echinoderms are known."

                data-description="Rugose corals are often referred to as "horn corals" because of their curved conical shape. They are easily recognized by the radiating septa visible when looking at the open end of the coral. Each 'horn' would have only held a single polyp, but it was not unusual for many of these corals to grow in close proximity to each other.  "

Each hexagonal hole would have held a single polyp (similar to an upside-down jellyfish) so that thousands of polyps would live together in a single colonial structure that grows upwards over time. "

Some species lived on the seafloor while others appeared to aimlesssly drift in the oceans like plankton."
