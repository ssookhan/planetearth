Trilobites are named after the three longitudinal lobes (tri-lobe) that characterize their body plan. Like many arthropods, trilobites moulted regularly by breaking upen it's exoskeleton in the head region. Most trilobite fossils are therefore only the moulted tail, which stays whole throughout the moulting process."
