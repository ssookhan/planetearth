His current research focus involves developing process based models of fuel moisture exchange, fire ignition and spread that can be applied by fire management agencies throughout Canada. This work, in part, involves development of models for the Canadian Forest Serviceâ€™s Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS), a system used operationally throughout Canada and a growing number of countries around the world. His previous research has focused on the projection of climate change impacts on fire activity and management in Canada using of fire danger and fire occurrence models.

Prior to that, he was engaged at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (now a Faculty of Dalhousie University) in the Department of Mathematics and Physics (1993-94) at the institution. He holds several degrees: a BSc (Honours, Mathematics and Ecology) from Dalhousie University (1981), a BSc (Dynamic Meteorology) from the University of Alberta (1982), an MSc (Forest Meteorology) from UNB (1985), and a PhD (Forest-Atmosphere Interactions; 1993), also from UNB. At UNB, he teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in environmental meteorology, ecohydrology, ecological modelling, landscape modelling, and climate change. He is author and co-author of more than 120 scientific papers. He was principal investigator for the NB-component of the Fluxnet-Canada Project (2002-2007); a project designed to measure and model the fundamentals of soil-vegetation-atmosphere interactions with high-frequency measurements of biospheric fluxes, with fully integrated daily and year-round summaries. Lately, his interests have taken him to China (2008-present), where he served the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) as an expert advisor on matters related to ecohydrometeorology and landscape development processes in arid to semi-arid regions of NW China. His collaboration with CMA has recently led to his involvement with scientists at the Beijing Forestry University (BFU) as Adjunct Professor. Dr. Bourque regularly gives a course in Ecological Statistics and Modelling to 50-80 graduate students at BFU (2013-present) and writes peer-reviewed papers with his colleagues at BFU. Dr. Bourque is also one of several principal investigators at the ecological tower established in the Acadian Research Forest in southcentral New Brunswick. The tower is part of a joint research effort with forest scientists with the Canadian Forest Service - Atlantic Forestry Centre in Fredericton and UNB.</h6>" data-lity>[...more]</a></p>
