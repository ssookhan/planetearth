# Planet Earth Online
Planet Earth explores the fundamental concepts of how our planet works, including:

1. Plate tectonics
2. Deep internal structure and composition of the planet
3. Evolution of the biosphere and atmosphere
4. Relationship between geology and human history
5. Modern natural and anthropogenic environmental challenges

Currently there is a bottleneck in our capacity to handle escalating enrollments because:
- The large class size prohibits laboratories
- There is no appropriate textbook
- High enrollment places excessive demand on existing lecture facilities

Planet Earth Online will enhance the student learning experience by developing 10 online modules equivalent to content of the entire course.
