        "text": "Ice cores taken from Greenland in the early 1990's provided some of the first high-resolution measurements of climate change accompanying deglaciation of the Northern Hemisphere. Two research groups operated in Greenland: the Europeans with GRIP, and the Americans with GISP-2, extracting two ice cores within a year of each other and within 30 kilometers of each other, each just over 3 km long and covering the last 100,000 years of earths history. A temperature record was interpreted from oxygen isotopic data and showed that the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene was surprisingly fast and accompanied by dramatic swings in temperature. \n<br><br>\n<b>Heinrich (H)</b> events are when rapid deglaciation causes armadas of icebergs to break off the ice sheet, leaving layers of concentrated ice rafted debris (IRD) in deep sea sediment cores in the North Atlantic. The large volume of fresh water entering the oceans during a Heinrich event may alter global thermohaline circulation. \n<br><br>\n<b>Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger (D-O)</b> events are short episodes of rapid warming, typically in a matter of decades, followed by gradual cooling. For example at the end of the Younger Dryas, average annual temperature over Greenland warmed by around 8 \u00b0C over 40 years. \n<br><br>\nThe <b>B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d</b> interstadial was a warm and moist interstadial that occurred during the final stages the Wisconsin glacial period. During this time, global sea level rose by approximately 16 m due to ice melting and thermal expansion. \n<br><br>\nGlacial conditions returned abruptly, but temporarily for about 1300 years during the <b>Younger Dryas</b> stadial period. Though causes are debated, possible culprits include changes to oceanic thermohaline circulation as a result of glacial lake outburst floods, and changes to incoming solar radiation. Cooling was enhanced in the North Atlantic, while the Southern Hemisphere generally warmed slightly. \n\n<iframe src=\"https://planetearth.utsc.utoronto.ca/charts/dynamic/20_ka_Alley_2004.html\" width=\"100%\" height=300px scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>"

      "headline": "The Holocene", 
      "text": "The Holocene refers to the past 11,700 years of geological time. It encompasses the period following the deglaciation of continental-scale ice sheets in the northern hemisphere, up to today. In this module, we will look at the major climatic events of the Holocene in order to understand what is the climate \"norm\" for this time period.\n<br><br>\nIn this figure, we see an overview of paleotemperature data from two sources. One curve is oxygen isotope data preserved in the Greenland ice cores, which portrayed the Holocene as a period of relative stability with short-lived anomalies. The second curve is generated from multiple proxies across the globe, and reveals that in addition to short-lived or regional anomalies, \"global\" climate also experienced a long-term cooling trend. Generally, the Holocene can be divided into the early warm \"hypsithermal\" and the later cooler \"neoglacial\".\n<br>\n\n<br><br><b> Learning Objectives: </b>\n<br><br>1.  Summarize the main nature of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.\n<br><br>2.  Recognize the wide range of climate proxies used to reconstruct Holocene paleotemperatures and their applications.\n<br><br>3.  Evaluate evidence for some of the recent climatic events of the Holocene like the LIA and MWP."
