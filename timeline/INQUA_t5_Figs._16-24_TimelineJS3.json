A) Faulted Paleozoic strata across hard bed resulting from the propagation of Proterozoic structures, such as terrane boundaries, likely due to distal field stresses associated with the Appalachian orogenies and the building of Pangea. B) Structure of the Canadian Shield showing terrane boundaries exposed to the north and buried sub-Paleozoic boundaries to south. Note the prominent Central Metasedimentary Belt Boundary Zone (CMBBZ), which is seismogenic. Bedrock structure controls the location of major bedrock valleys cut into Paleozoics now filled with thick sediment, and which also guided subglacial meltwater flows across the hard bed (Fig. 10)."

A) Topography of Peterborough Drumlin Field just east of Peterborough with sites 22A to 22D mentioned in the text. Higher standing drumlinized \u2018uplands\u2019 west of Trent River are cored by antecedent sediment. East of the river, the overall topography is much reduced and residual outliers of the upland surface show consistent downglacier changes from large drumlins into \u2018channeled drumlins\u2019 to megascale glacial lineations (MSGLs) that record erosional lowering of bed. The same overall downglacier bedform evolution is shown by the beds of ice streams in New York State (Fig. 23) and suggests headward propagation of fast flow and accompanying erosion of the drumlinized bed into MSGLs (Fig. 24). B) Suggested evolution of MSGLs from a large drumlin uplands (DU) as a result of progressive bed lowering and smoothing to produce a low-drag surface, which enables fast flow. </font> "

In this model drumlins and MSGLs form a bedform continuum that is controlled by changing ice velocity."
