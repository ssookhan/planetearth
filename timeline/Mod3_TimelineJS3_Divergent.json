Sediment that washes off of the steep marginal cliffs becomes trapped and starts to form shelves of sediment along the coastline. If there is no exchange of water with the ocean, these basins are prone to evaporation, leaving thick salt deposits behind. In the accompanying image, gravitational anomalies have been detected in the northern part of the Red Sea. Hard rock is typically denser and thus has a stronger gravitational attractive force than sediments or salt deposits. The resulting image thus shows the shape of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbedrock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbasement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122  before it was covered by a sedimentary drape. The trapping of sediment within subsided rift valleys eventually results in the broad continental shelves that occur on passive margins worldwide.  "

Some mid ocean ridges produce oceanic crust very quickly (fast-spreading ridges) while others produce new oceanic crust more slowly (slow-spreading ridges). We can use the rates of spreading to reconstruct when various plate tectonic events, such as the opening of a new ocean basin, occurred. Oceanic crust becomes heavier and denser at it ages, and eventually begins to sink into the mantle and is destroyed in a process called subduction.   \n<br><br>\nThe continents are generally much older than the oceans and grow when crustal material that is too dense to be subducted is scraped onto their margins. This process is known as obduction or accretion. Continents therefore tend to be oldest in their interiors and get younger towards the margins. \n<br><br>\n<img src=\"https://planetearth.utsc.utoronto.ca/timeline/content/globescale.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 300px;\">"
