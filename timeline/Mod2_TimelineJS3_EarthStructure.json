Others work in the laboratory performing experimental work or in the office creating models and maps. Geologists often deal with practical matters like finding natural resources (petroleum, natural gas, groundwater and metals), and to predicting natural hazards (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions etc.). Despite modern technology, we still know very little about the Earth and Geologists are forever trying to learn more about the subsurface. Drilling into the Earth's crust can provide geologists with samples, but even the deepest drilling project on Earth, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, only extended 12.3 km into the crust, a tiny fraction of Earth's ~6300 km radius.

Figuring out where a given feature is on that irregular ellipsoid (or \"geoid\") is important because the Earth's surface is constantly changing. Nowadays, satellite-based tracking system are extremely popular. Most of us have used the Global Positioning System (GPS) for example in our cars and phones to get around, but it can also be used to track very small movements of tectonic plates. GPS receivers calculate their position from the time it takes for a signal to be transmitted from three satellites of known position to the receiver."

Seismic reflection surveys, for example, are a technique where a pulse of energy (like a sound or an explosion) created on the surface is reflected and refracted back to a set of receivers. Energy travels at different speeds through different types of materials, thus the speed at which waves are returned can create an image of the subsurface. "

Most gravimeters are effectively a weight on a spring, and they can be mounted on vehicles, aircrafts, and ships. Gravitational anomalies can be used to determine if a region is in isostatic equilibrium, to indicate unusually dense or light regions underground, and to quantify atmospheric mass variations, tides, groundwater level variations, and soil moisture variations."

The normal geothermal gradient is about 25 degrees Celsius per kilometer near the surface. Continental crust tends to insulate the interior of the Earth, preventing heat in the core and mantle from reaching the surface, but heat is also produced in the continental crust by radioactive minerals releasing energy. Oceanic crust is primarily heated from the mantle below. The heat flow from Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior to the surface through young oceanic crust ultimately drives many deep Earth processes (see figure, Davies and Davies, 2010)."

The motion of one lithospheric plate relative to another is called relative plate motion. At divergent boundaries, the plates are pulling away from each other, forcing new plate material to be created to fill that gap. At transform boundaries, plates slide past each other with no addition or destruction of either plate. At convergent margins, two plates collide, either resulting in the destruction of the denser plate at a subduction zone, or the crumpling of the two plates into an orogeny (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mountain belt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Tectonic plates also have an absolute plate motion, which is the motion of a plate relative to a stationary point. Stationary mantle plumes for example help us to track absolute plate motion because they leave behind chains of volcanic islands as the lithospheric plate above slides past. Some chains visible on the seafloor were created by mantle plumes that no longer exist.           \n\n<img src=\"https://planetearth.utsc.utoronto.ca/timeline/content/plateboundarylegend.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 300px;\">"

During subduction for example, cold slabs of lithosphere descend into the mantle, dragging relatively cool upper mantle downwards.
