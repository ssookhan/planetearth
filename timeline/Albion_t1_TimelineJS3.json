Shallow seas covered the continent and sedimentary rocks were deposited in \nsubhorizontal layers upon the ancient Precambrian basement rocks. This is a fairly calm period with little tectonic activity. \nThe Appalachian Mountains formed during the Taconic mountain building phase (Ordovician) to the east were wearing down and as a \nresult, less sediment was being produced. Sedimentary systems started to deliver increasingly finer sediment to the \nNiagara region, and eventually, the waters cleared up, resulting in the production of limestones in the shallow marine waters.

Describe and classify basic sedimentary rocks, sedimentary structures and fossils using real-world examples.\n<br><br>2. Draw conclusions about the age, identity, and conditions under which these rocks were deposited. \n<br><br>3. Summarize the main events of environmental change during the Silurian of Southern Ontario.\n<br><br> \n<b> Assignment: </b>\n<br><br> Navigate the following pages and use the given information plus (lab) hand samples to answer the following questions.
