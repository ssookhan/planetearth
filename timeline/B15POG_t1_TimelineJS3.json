A more formal statement of the Law of Superposition is that in an undeformed conformable sequence of sedimentary rocks, the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the sequence while the youngest strata will be on top. For the case of deformed rocks, it is important to determine which way is \"up\" in order to determine the direction of \"younging\". \n<br><br> On the next slide, we will take a look at the Paleozoic stratigraphy of Niagara Gorge. This is a gorgeous example of the Law of Superposition: rocks at the top of the succession are younger than  those at the bottom. "

It can also be applied (with caution) to some other rock types like lava which tends to pool.  Deviations from horizontal can be a product of the deposition on a slope, but is usually attributed to deformation like folding, faulting, uplift and subsidence. \n<br><br>\nOn the next slide, you will be taken to an outcrop of strata near Desbarats, Ontario. These rocks are no longer in a horizontal position, but by looking for evidence for \"younging\" you will be able to determine in what position the rocks where originally deposited."

Because we know quite a bit about the branches of evolution, it is often possible to date a given fossiliferous outcrop by the assemblage held within. This is the basis for <b>biostratigraphy:</b>  the practise of correlating units by fossil assemblage.  \n<br><br>\nOn the next slide, we will look at an outcrop of fossiliferous limestone from the Port Colborne Quarry in Ontario. In this trip, we will provide you with a simplified guide to what the distribution of fossils throughout geologic time. By comparing this list to the fossils actually found at Port Colborne, you will be able to determine a rough estimate for how old these rocks are.

Unit F is a dike. We do not know for sure whether the dike was intruded through units A to E before they were tilted, or after, but both the intrusion and the tilting happened prior to the cutting of the angular unconformity. Units G, H, I, J, K, L were then deposited. Magma M intruded the lower package as a pluton, with dikes shooting up to unit L (and possibly beyond). A second unconformity was cut as a disconformity. Units N and O fill the topography cut on that surface. \n<br><br>\nOn the next slide, there is a virtual outcrop where we can accomplish a similar synthesis.
