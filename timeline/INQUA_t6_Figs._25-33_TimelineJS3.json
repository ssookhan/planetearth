These valleys have been the focus of recent 3-D subsurface sediment mapping by Mulligan et al. (2018a). The large inset box shows the location of channels on the bed of the Simcoe Ice Stream at the southern end of Lake Simcoe (Fig. 33). B) Digital elevation model of the bed of the Simcoe Ice Stream (SIS) showing the location of Stop 8. C) Hillshaded relief map of same area. Drumlins within or along the lower flanks of valleys are highlighted with an \u2018x\u2019 at their stoss (NE) end. Shoreline features and groundwater piping features are shown in yellow; note the glaciofluvial outwash system that originates at a recessional moraine (solid black line) in the south within the ORM, and terminates as a large fan delta (shown as a circled R) north of the ORM (Roseville Delta). This likely indicates earlier northward retreat of the Simcoe Ice Stream compared to the Halton Ice Stream (HIS) south of the ORM (Figs. 14B, 26)."
