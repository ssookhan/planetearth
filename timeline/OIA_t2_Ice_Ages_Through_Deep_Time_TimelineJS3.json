        "text": "The separation of Antarctica and South America was a prolongued process that resulted in the opening and subsidence (deepening) of the Drake Passage between about 45 Ma to 24 Ma.  By about 24 Ma, it was deep enough to allow the development of an Antarctic Circum-polar Current that still operates today. This had two effects. Firstly, the circulating water inhibits heat in southwardly-migrating currents from reaching Antarctica. Secondly, since the water immediately adjacent Antarctica is very cold, it becomes extra dense and slips into the depths, fueling thermohaline circulation. \n <br><br> The ACC carries an estimated 165-182 million cubic metres of water every second."

The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at 55 Ma was a sudden and short-lived warming event of between 5\u20138 \u00b0C at the boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene Epochs. It was likely related to the release of 5-10,000 gigatons of carbon into the ocean and atmosphere in less than 10,000 years. The Eocene Optimum was a longer period of high temperatures, lasting from about 55 to 52 million years. During this time, carbon dioxide levels were between 1000 and 2000 ppm and temperature between 9-14\u00b0C  higher than today. What followed the Eocene was a long term gradual cooling leading into the Cenozoic Glacio-Epoch."

        "text": "Sometime around 70 million years ago, Greenland began to break away from North America, opening up Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea. This had two important concenquences: 1) Greenland was pushed further north, into the Arctic Circle. 2) This new seaway began to act as a factory for production of dense North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The formation of ice from waters circulating (and cooling) in polar areas expels salt, making a dense, nutrient-rich water body that sinks into the North Atlantic. This is a fundamental pump for the thermohaline circulation of the worlds oceans. The NADW ultimately makes its way southwards to join with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). "

        "text": "About 5 million years ago, convergence between the North American, South American, and Caribbean Plates began to restrict the flow of water between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Waters that once passed through the Central American Seaway began to be deflected towards the north Atlantic. This was the birth of the Gulf Stream which brought warm, salty water into the North Atlantic where it would cool. The formation of sea ice in northern hemispheres increases the density of water further by expelling salt. These dense water sink to the ocean floor as North Atlantic Deep Waters (NADW) thus driving the Ocean Conveyor Belt. \n<br><br>\nIt seems counterintuitive that the transport of heat into high latitudes would contribute to cooling. However, consider that with heat, comes moisture. The warm Gulf Stream brings with it moisture-laden air which can be transported by westerly winds to Eurasia where falls as rain or snow. The influx of freshwater to the Arctic would have facilitated the formation of sea ice, which, combined with glaciation in the Alps, would reflect more sunlight back into space. Water vapour from the Gulf Stream above 60 degrees latitude may get caught in the easterly trade winds which transport moisture towards Arctic Canada.  "

        "text": "A common misconception is that there only 4 'ice ages', refering to northern hemisphere continental-scale glaciations, during the Pleistocene. The isotopic record of deep sea sediments tells us a different story. Whenever ice is locked up on land, global sea levels fall. Ice has a different isotopic ratio than seawater, so when those water molecules are removed to make ice, it also changes the ratios of isotopes left behind in the seawater. Organisms like foraminifera (pictured here) precipitate their shells out of this sea water, and therefore we can look at the isotopic ratios within their shells to determine whether sea levels were high (during warm periods) or low (during cold periods when more water is locked up on land). Deep sea sediment cores through layers upon layers of dead foraminifera show these changes as a nearly continuous record. It is clear from looking at this chart that the frequency of ice ages is far higher than can be determined by looking for sedimentary deposits on land. Count the peaks. How many individual glaciations do you think there have been over the past 2 million years of the Cenozoic Glacio-Epoch? The control on the frequency of these individual glaciations is the Milankovitch Cycle. Subtle changes in Earth's orbital patterns change the amount and distribution of solar radiation, warming and cooling the globe."
