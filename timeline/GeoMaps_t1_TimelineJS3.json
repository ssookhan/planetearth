Azimuth Notation: </b><br>For this notation you use the round brackets, add the strike direction value first, add a slash and add the dip angle value after and close the round brackets. NOTE: Strike always have to be 3 ditigits. If your measurement is only one or two digits long add zeros in front to fill up to three digits. The dip angle has to be two digits long, hence use a zero in this case too.  <br><br>e.g. Strike: 23\u00b0, dip angle: 5\u00b0   -> Azimuth Notation: (023\u00b0/05\u00b0)   <br><br><b>2. Quadrant Notation:</b><br>For this notation you will have to take a look at the compass. The compass will be split up into two halfs, the upper half (270\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) and a lower half (90\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 to 270\u00b0). <br>If the strike is 23\u00b0, then your value is in the upper half and on the 23\u00b0 to the right side toward East (90\u00b0) in respect to North (0\u00b0). Hence, the first part of the Quadrant Notation is N23\u00b0E<br>For the second part we will use the dip angle of 5\u00b0. Note that Right-Hand-Rule shows us the dip direction (your straight fingers that point down slope) follows always by 90\u00b0 in clockwise direction to the strike direciton (23\u00b0, direction of your right thumb). The dip direction is where we also would measure the dip angle (between horizontal line and the dipping plane). We need this information for the second part of the Quadrant Notation: 23\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 113\u00b0 (dip direction). 113\u00b0 points toward East South East direction. <br>The second part of the Quartdant notation is: 5\u00b0ESE</b><br><br> Details are given on the figure to the left."
