        "text": "Little is known about the climate of the Archean, but at least one episode of glaciation is indicated. Usually, the Archean is thought of as a period of warmth because the atmosphere was heavily enriched in greenhouse gases. However, solar luminosity was about 20-30 less intense than it is today. The geologic record of the Archean is incredably sparse and thus evidence for glaciation in the Archean is rare. Limited evidence is present in 2.9 billion year old rocks of the Mozaan Group of South Africa from the margins of the Kaapvaal Craton which at the time was part of the supercontinent Ur. "

        "headline": "The Neoproterozoic Glacio-epochs", 
        "text": "The severity of glaciation in the Neoproterozoic is one of the mostly hotly contested debates in Earth Sciences today. Deposits of presumed glacial or glaciomarine origin are found on all continents from polar to equatorial paleolatitudes. In particular, evidence for ice at sea level near the equator has led many to believe that the earth was completely encased in ice under the premise that ice at low latitudes must mean ice was also present at high latitudes. This is popularly known as the  \"Snowball Earth Hypothesis\". Under the Snowball Earth Hypothesis, growing glaciers reflect so much sunlight back into space that the surface of the oceans actually freeze. This is called the 'runaway ice-albedo effect' and is an example of a positive feedback.  This state remains for tens of millions of years until sufficienct carbon dioxide and other volcanically-generated greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere to cause catastrophic melting. \n<br><br>\nMany aspects of this model are contested. Sedimentary deposits are notoriously difficult to date, particular in the Precambrian when no fossils can be used to constrain their age. The model requires that glaciations were effectively synchronous globally, but without high-resolution dating, this can be difficult to prove. There are also questions surrounding what the effects of a global freezing would be on the carbon cycle, and how such evidence would be preserved in the chemostratigraphic record. Much like the so-called \"Huronian\" glaciations of the Paleoproterozoic, the environmental interpretation of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits is questionable. The geological consensus is largely moving away from catastrophic global freezing to a more normal dynamic style of glaciation similar to the Cenozoic. "

It was centred on northern South America which at the time was at a mid to high paleolatitude. Cooling has been linked to two events of global importance that resulted in the drawdown of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The first was the building of the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains rivalled the Himalayas in scale and their uplift undoubtedly was accompanied with increased weathering of feldspar minerals which consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide. The second event was the 'greening' of the continents by land plants. Land plants contributed to the drawdown of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and also by increasing the breakdown of silicate rocks. "
