B) Converging ice streams (SIS: Simcoe Ice Stream and HIS: Halton Ice Stream) during the final retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet sometime shortly before 13,000 ybp. The Oak Ridges Moraine was deposited in a narrow glaciolacustrine depocentre trapped between the two ice streams and dammed to the west by the Niagara Escarpment (Fig. 26)."

        "caption": "Figure 15. Simplified distribution of hard and soft beds below principal ice streams in Southern Ontario. Inset boxes A, B, and C are the locations of the glacially streamlined bedrock surfaces shown in Figures 18, 20, and 21, respectively. The hard bed is offset by numerous faults (Fig. 17). Insets D and E are locations of Figures 22 and 26, which show typical streamlined soft beds with megascale glacial lineations. Note the large expanse of the so-called Dummer Moraine, which is composed of limestone rubble plucked from north-facing escarpments."
