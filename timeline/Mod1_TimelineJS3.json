The Niagara Gorge would prove in the 18th and 19th century to be a key line of evidence in estimations of the age of the Earth, particularly after it was demonstrated by Charles Lyell in 1842 that the 10-km long gorge was formed by the gradual recession of Niagara Falls from the Niagara Escarpment. Hennepins documentation of the area was extremely important to geologists who estimated that the rate of recession was about 1 m per year, and thus that it must have taken many thousands of years for falls to recede to their present position. Figures ranged from 5000 to 54000 years, generally exceeding the age of the Earth as estimated from biblical sources.  "

Later, the Great Neopolitan Quake of 1857 provided an opportunity to investigate the damaging effects of seismic waves in a natural environment.

Kelvin modelled the Earth as a ball of molten magma and based his calculations on the rate at which such a ball would cool to have the current geothermal gradient. At the time, little was known of the structure of the interior of the earth, nor of the effects of radioactivity in warming the Earth, thus rendering Kelvin's estimate to be far too young. However, his age determination was far older than previous determinations which led to a new understanding of the rate of geologic processes and also substatiated the growing theory of evolution as proposed by Charles Darwin.

The depth of the seafloor was determined through a technique called 'sounding' in which a a heavy rope with a weight was lowered to the bottom. Broad 'plateaus' were identified separating 'deeps' which were areas of the seafloor with depths greater than 3000 fathoms (5,486 m). The mere fact that the seafloor was not a uniform bowl-shape was surprising at the time. The origin of these enormous features was not realized for many years, but ultimately played a critical role in understanding plate tectonics. "

This process, called \"nuclear decay\" generates heat which meant that simple models of the Earth's age calculated from cooling rates needed to account for this new source of heating. Furthermore, Rutherford suggested that the rate of radioactive decay could be quantified by the concept of a half life, which is the time it takes for half of an amount of radioactive material to decay, and also proposed that this property might be of use in dating rocks.

He was thus in an ideal position to update the age of the Earth from the estimates made earilier by Lord Kelvin based on the rate of heat loss from Earth's interior. The presence of convection currents in the mantle meant that assumptions about the rate of Earth's cooling were inaccurate, while radioactive decay of elements was creating new heat. Holmes' re-evaluated the age of the earth to 1.6 billion years old, still about 3 billions years short of the figure accepted today. "

Some countries, like Canada, chose to develop independent seismic monitoring networks.

These 'Benioff Zones' record seismicity from a downgoing slab of lithosphere and are located at what later became known as 'subduction zones'. This motion produces earthquakes up to depths of about 700 km. Subduction zones are where tectonic plates get destroyed."

These chains of guyots or seamounts record the direction and velocity of moving tectonic plates."

These stripes confirmed Hess's hypothesis of sea floor spreading. As magma erupts at the mid ocean ridge, small magnetic particals crystallize in the direction of Earth's magnetic field. Reversals in the polarity of Earth's magnetic field occur periodically, resulting in alternating stripes of positive and negative polarity on the seafloor away from the mid oceanic ridge. This observation confirmed the model of seafloor spreading because it showed that the age of the seafloor increased away from mid ocean ridges, thus that must be where new oceanic crust was formed. This explanation for magnetic stripes is known today as the Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis. In 1963, Lawrence Morley, a Canadian geophysicist, had his hypothesis on the origin of magnetic stripes turned down for publication as being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo speculative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but was later co-credited with Fred Vine and Drummond Matthews.

In many ways, this was the culmination of the many individual pieces of the plate tectonic puzzle. As Wilson described it, tectonic plates were rigid and could only bend at their margins. Oceanic plates form when continental crust is pulled apart. Oceanic crust is generated at mid ocean ridges via sea floor spreading, and destroyed at subduction zones. If all of the oceanic crust between two continents is destroyed, those continents collide to form mountain ranges. This is the basis for the Wilson Cycle which describes the growth and decay of supercontinents. "

The satellites have very stable orbits at 6000 km above Earth's surface, and are not predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere for another 8.4 million years. The purpose of LAGEOS was to enable very accurate measurement of Earth's crust in order to detect the shape of the geoid and the speed and direction of crustal movements. LAGEOS improved accuracy of geodetic measurements from about 1 meter to about 1 centimeter.  A plaque designed by Carl Sagan and illustrating the break-up of Pangea and projected position of the continents upon LAGEOS's return to Earth is embedded within. "
