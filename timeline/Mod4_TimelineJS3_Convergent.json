        "text": "When two tectonic plates with oceanic crust  converge on each other, The denser of the two plates begins to subduct under the other. The density of a plate is related to its age. As oceanic crust is pushed away from a mid ocean ridge, it cools and thickens, and becomes metamorphosed by circulating hydrothermal fluids, increasing its overall density. As the subducting slab of oceanic crust descends into the mantle, it triggers melting and magma production, resulting in the formation of a volcanic arc in the overriding plate above. \n\nExample: The Mariana Trench and Arc"

        "headline": "The Mariana Trench",
        "text": "The Mariana Trench is the deepest feature on planet Earth and marks the point where the Pacific and Philippine plates meet. The crust of the Pacific Plate has been travelling for about 170 million years since it was created at the East Pacific Rise, and has been cooling and thickening throughout it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journey. The Philippine Plate however, is much smaller and only started forming about 60 million years ago. The older, denser plate begins to descend under the younger plate and into the mantle in a process known as subduction. The rate of the sinking of the Pacific Plate is so great that it actually pulls the Philippine Plate forwards, causing tension and sea floor spreading in behind the volcanic ar (known as the 'back arc'). Above the subduction zone, an arcuate chain of volcanoes (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolcanic arc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) scar the seafloor. "

By tracking the depth of earthquake foci, a picture of the subducting slab emerges. Below about 700 km,  rocks begin to deform plastically, rather than fracturing or breaking, and therefore tend not to produce earthquakes."

Subduction of the Pacific Plate creates the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is the region of intense earthquake and volcanic activity.\n\nThis globe shows the locations and magnitudes of all earthquakes during June and July 2017. Earthquakes predominantly occur on plate margins. Divergent and transform margins typically experience relatively shallow earthquakes compared to convergent margins. Subduction zones often have a characteristic pattern of increasing earthquake depth in the direction that the plate is sinking, a phenomenon known as the Benioff Zone. \n\n<img src=\"https://planetearth.utsc.utoronto.ca/timeline/content/convmarginlegend.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 300px;\">"

        "text": "The Mediterranean is the remnant of an ocean basin called the Tethys Ocean which once separated Europe from Africa. Over the last 150 million years, the Mediterranean has been shrinking through the process of subduction. Now, there is very little oceanic crust left, and many pieces of continental crust have started to collide with each other forming an orogenic belt known as the Alpine Orogeny. Some of these smaller continental slivers, also called terranes, are made of andesitic volcanic material that is too buoyant to subduct, while others are made of thick sediment accumulations on the ocean floor. Others still are pieces of much older continental crust which have rifted off of other continents. Opening of the Red Sea continues to cause the African and Arabian Plate to swing northwards and someday the Mediterranean may close entirely. "
