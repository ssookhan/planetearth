Early ideas were that the Shield was simply cooled crust in keeping with the notion of a once molten planet. Observations of the deformed marbles of the Hastings Highlands in the 1850's by Sir William Logan and others area resulted in the new notion that much rock had been sedimentary in origin but much altered by Metamorphism (Sites C115 ). The term 'Hastings Series' was used in the 1860's to refer to such strata. Final understanding about 100 years later had to await the identification of 'terranes' or large blocks of rock that formerly had been small landmasses or islands made up of sedimentary strata and all brought together and deformed by plate tectonic processes about 1 billion years ago during formation of the Grenville Mountains and the Supercontinent Rodinia .,y,45.246692,-77.947323,86.93,0,0.96,n,13,a,NA,sitePictures/C127a.jpg,sitePictures/C127b.jpg,sitePictures/C127c.jpg,sitePictures/C127d.jpg

This means that much of Ontario is actually being tilted down to the south. In central Ontario the greatest rate of crustal uplift (some 21 cm a century) occurs along the northern shoreline of Georgian Bay near the outlet of the French River and near Manitoulin Island. In contrast the southern shore of Georgian Bay at Collingwood is only rising at 7 cm a century and the outlet of Lake Huron still further south at Sarnia, is actually subsiding because crustal rebound has ended in this area and the whole of the Lake Huron Basin is being tilted down to the southwest. This means that over the last 50 years alone Georgian Bay has risen at least 10 cm relative to the outlet of Lake Huron. As time goes by water depths near Parry Sound will continue to drop by 20 cm a century independent of climatically-driven fluctuations in lake level, as crustal uplift continues. In many places in northern Georgian Bay old water levels marks occur as much as 3 m above the modern lake level and have been uplifted as the crust of northern Georgian Bay slowly rebounds after the last ice age when ice as much as 2 km thick, covered the region.

These afforded opportunities for farming amid the otherwise rocky Shield.  In northern Ontario, the enormous ‘Clay Belts’ near Kirkland Lake, Cochrane and New Liskeard are of similar age and origin and were vigorously promoted in Europe as ‘new lands’ in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries but their cold wet soils and short growing season prevented much development. Today, the success of the ‘glacial lake oasis’ communities of Muskoka obscures their cold glacial origins and ironically mirrors the extensive use of the shoreline of glacial lake Algonquin by the first residents of Ontario (Paleo-Indian peoples) some 12,000 years ago just as the last ice sheet was melting back.",y,44.9200532,-79.3909866,342.62,0,85.3,n,14,,NA,sitePictures/C159a.jpg,sitePictures/C159b.jpg,sitePictures/C159b.jpg,sitePictures/C159b.jpg

Eventually this leaves large 'core stones' of intact granite surrounded by soft clay (See N59). If the climate shifts to a to a wetter one, the clay gets washed out leaving enormous piles of large boulders perched precariously on top of one another. Tors are common in southwest England (on Dartmoor) and this one at Dartmoor, Ontario, was almost certainly named by a settler after the distinctive granite landforms of their homeland. They are very rare in Ontario because the last ice sheets ran over them, knocked them down, and carried the boulders southwards as glacial erratics.

It blankets large areas of limestone plain and escarpment faces and extends southwards to cover drift drumlins. Historically, it has been viewed as a late-glacial still-stand or re-advance frontal moraine ridge but sedimentological work suggests it is largely the result of intense quarrying of escarpment faces, very limited subglacial and englacial transport and passive melt-out. It reflects intense lateral and frontal plucking of drumlinized interfluves along Paleozoic escarpments and has been partially and fully reworked by subglacial meltwaters often being present in esker cores that occupy through valleys between drumlinized interfluves. Quarrying of escarpments has been the primary source of the carbonate debris that dominates tills and other glacial sediments in Southern Ontario. 
<br><br>
The large tract of Dummer Moraine was a major obstacle to mid-nineteenth European settlers faced with the prospect of ‘farming rocks’ on the limestone plains south of the Shield(popularly known as ‘the land in between’). It is a strangely attractive landscape of bare limestone plain, hummocks of bouldery rubble with large slabs of limestone, farms that have gone back to bush, lakes and forest with the odd small patch of glacial sediment that can be grazed. It but it comes alive in the fall when dark rock is exposed by thinning foliage and juxtaposed against red maples; a classic Ontario glacial landscape now recognized as part of the ‘hard bed’ of an ice stream.

Tors are common in southwest England (on Dartmoor) and this one at Dartmoor, Ontario, was almost certainly named by a settler after the distinctive granite landforms of their homeland.

At the time, it was believed that the Shield was composed of ""fundamental gneisses"" formed when the Earth's original molten crust had cooled. Logan, though, recognized that the gneiss showed evidence of having formerly been sedimentary rocks that had been changed by metamorphism. This key observation violated the long-held belief that the Shield was simply cooled crust. Logan also established that there were large bodies of igneous intrusive rock in the Shield.

Uplift is the result of ‘mantle isostasy’ where the brittle Earth’s crust is supported by a much softer mantle; any increase in the thickness and/or weight of the crust (from mountain building or from an ice sheet) pushes the crust down into the mantle which is displaced laterally. As mountains become eroded or ice sheets melt mantle material flows back and the crust ‘rebounds.’ This process is still happening today in northern Ontario and is called ‘glacio-isostasy.’ During the earliest phase of glacio-isostatic recovery uplift rates were 10 m every 100 years; today parts of the Hudson Bay and James Bay coasts are being uplifted on average about 1 m every 100 years such as this area near Fort Severn. This has resulted in uplift of beaches well above sea level that were once at, or just below, sea level. In this way, Ontario is slowly gaining new land every year!

These rivers migrate slowly across the landscape leaving abandoned semi-circular shaped water-filled channels (‘meander cut-offs’) that fill with mud and peat. The gradient if these rivers is further reduced as they approach the rapidly uplifting coastline of Hudson and James bays where the rivers also have to flow across thick muskeg and through wetlands. In these areas, rivers commonly display a very different form said to be ‘anastomosed’ which is seen as multiple channels consisting of almost straight channels that largely parallel each other but which are connected by smaller channels; the thick cover of vegetation plays a key role by greatly reducing the ability of the river channels to migrate through time and the channels becomes fixed. Because of their low gradients the rivers of northern Ontario are popular with canoeists.  All the northern rivers freeze up in the winter and have thick ice covers.

The region was subjected to a complex and dynamic deglacial history during ice melting which is well preserved within the park limits. About 12000-11000 years ago, a small readvancement of ice is recorded in the deposition of the Dog Lake Moraine which still dams in Dog Lake on it's southern bank. This ice lobe resulted in the damming of the Kaministiquia River into a small glacial lake called Glacial Lake Kaministiquia. Draining of this lake through the 'spillway' of the Kaministiquia river valley caused erosion of soft deltaic sediments and carving of a steep bedrock-floored valley. During the fur trade, the Kaministiquia River was the main route connecting Lake Superior to the prairies once the far easier route through Grand Portage was cut off by negotiation of the Canada-US border.

In one case, a dynamite explosion started a fire that destroyed many buildings. Outbreaks of smallpox, and typhoid were caused by poor living conditions. Several mines were abandoned following mining, and now lay in ruin. For example, here at Cobalt Lake Mine, blasting in 1932 broke through the bedrock cap, causing 400,000 tons of mill tailings to pour into the mine.",n,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,n,13,NA,NA,sitePictures/N324a.jpg,sitePictures/N324b.jpg,sitePictures/N324c.jpg,sitePictures/N324d.jpg

Some 12,500 years ago, much of the Toronto area was flooded by glacial Lake Iroquois which was some 45 metres deeper (higher) than the modern Lake Ontario. This was because the last ice sheet still blocked the St. Lawrence River Valley (the outlet of the Great Lakes) creating an enormous ice-dammed lake. The shoreline of this lake is still visible today (Site S14). The lake drained very quickly when the plug (ice) was pulled out of the St. Lawrence and lake levels dropped to well below that of the modern Lake Ontario.  Much of the area now covered by Lake Ontario was in fact dry land because sea level was still low; huge volumes of water which would otherwise flow to the sea still remained trapped in the ice sheet that lingered over northern Canada).

These are very common across the many limestone  plains of southern Ontario particularly on Manitoulin Island.  Such activity is part of what geologists call 'chemical weathering .'
