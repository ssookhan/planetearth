      <div class="w3-half">
    <p>In 10 fully online modules, students review the history and workings of the planet, the geological and environmental history of Ontario, and show how the economic and social development of the province reflects its broader environmental setting and history. Each module features the following content enrichment strategies:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Illustration of key foundation concepts, processes and phenomena through an assortment of instructional videos, interactive diagrams, and animations</li>
      <li>Exercises involving the hands-on use of spatial and temporal technologies, data analysis, and virtual field trips (VFTâ€™s)</li>
      <li>Case studies and examples from across Ontario</li>
      <li>Animations and documentary film footage</li>
      <li>Media components based on rock and mineral collections</li>

  <div class="bio">Nick Eyles has been a Professor of Geology at UTSC since 1982 after having graduated from the universities of Leicester, Memorial (Nfld) and East Anglia, and lectured at Newcastle University. He is interested in the geologic record of cold climates and ice ages throughout Earth history and how that reflects the broader plate tectonic setting in which such deposits occur. He has worked on all continents; his most recent investigations were in Congo. He has spent many years completing research projects at modern ice sheets and glaciers and has worked with the International Ocean Drilling program in Antarctica. He has written or edited specialist geology books and those for the public, many of which have won awards. He hosted a major documentary series (Geologic Journey for CBC) and others which have been nominated for Gemini awards. He is the recipient of the Ward Neale Medal from the Geological Association of Canada and the McNeill Medal from the Royal Society of Canada, as well as from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, and Geoscience Information Society for his public outreach.</div>
