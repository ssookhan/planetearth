In some cases, foolhardy photographers venture out on the precipice of the bluffs to catch their own iconic photo of the lake and beaches below (Figure 1).

    <span class="text">Geographic Information System (GIS) methodologies are an essential tool for glacial research looking to understand the spatial distribution and character of landforms.  While manual mapping can typically be done, to optimize the use of large his resolution data sets a more efficient approach is necessary.

    <span class="text">If you live out of town in central Ontario, chances are you get your drinking water from a water well that taps into groundwater stored in glacial sediments deep below. The biggest source of groundwater in the Greater Toronto Area is the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM), an 160 km long line of hills and hummocks up to 300 m in elevation (more than 200 m above the level of Lake Ontario at 75 m above sea level) stretching from the Niagara Escarpment in the west to east of Peterborough (Figure 1). It is Ontario’s largest glacial landform and is well known among hikers and mountain bikers alike, for its many forested trails including the Trans-Canada Trail which winds its way along the summit of the ridge. The same groundwaters emerge at surface on the south side of the ridge where numerous springs feed the many rivers that drain to Lake Ontario. </span><a href="ORM_2021_09_20.html">Read More</a>

      <p class="w3-center">by <a href="/#andrew-zajch">Andrew Zajch</a>, 11/17/2021</p>
    <span class="text">Visualizations are an essential tool for researchers studying glacial landforms. The Planet Earth lab has been using new technologies and data processing methods to develop 3D images of topographic surfaces to provide a new perspective on old problems.  See an example from the Rice Lake Corridor in Ontario, a region ripe with glacial landforms (Figure 1). The adoption of 3D visualization is revolutionary in the sense that it transitions our typically used natural plane view of landforms to new points of view that help us look at the morphologies from all angles. This leads to new information about landform features and their dynamics that previously could not be discerned from conventionally used approaches and views. </span><a href="rice_lake_2021_11_16.html">Read More</a>

      <p class="w3-center">by <a href="/#andrew-zajch">Andrew Zajch</a>, 11/12/2021</p>
    <span class="text">You may have witnessed the recent remarkable footage from the Aso Volcano, Japan, which experienced an eruption on October 20th, 2021, resulting in the spewing of menacing ash clouds that blanketed the neighboring areas. Specifically, the activity was observed at Mount Nakadake which lies at the center of relic Aso Caldera which is one of the largest calderas in the world (ASO UNESCO GLOBAL GEOPARK, 2012).  This elevated the volcanic warning to a level 3, indicating that the volcano should not be approached, from a level 2 where only approaching the present caldera was to be avoided (Japan Meteorological Agency, 2021). Hearing this news, I couldn’t help but recall my trip to Japan in 2019 when I was lucky enough to travel to the Aso area, located within the Kumamoto Prefecture, during a two-day road trip through the island of Kyushu. The area is roughly 6 hours by the fastest bullet train from Tokyo, with an additional 1-2 hours needed to access the site by car or public transit. </span><a href="mountasoeruption_2021_10_25.html">Read More</a>

    <span class="text">At the recent GAC- MAC London 2021 joint annual conference PhD Candidate Shane Sookhan gave a talk titled <strong>“LiDAR-based quantitative assessment of drumlin to mega-scale glacial lineation continuums and flow of the paleo Seneca-Cayuga paleo-Ice Stream”</strong>. This work covered Shane’s recent PhD work that utilizes high-resolution data to map glacial landforms to shed light on the behavior of past ice sheets that once covered Ontario. Shane emphasized that the availability of high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) around the great lakes has created new possibilities for identifying glacial landforms. Contrasting the high-resolution LiDAR data against lower resolution topographic data clearly demonstrates the utility of the LiDAR data for observing MSGLs (mega-scale glacial lineation), linear grooves, which are only revealed in the higher resolution image (1 m) (Figure 1).  </span><a href="gac_shane_2021_11_11.html">Read More</a>

    <span class="text">Thanks to a substantial grant from the University of Toronto and the Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences to Professors Adam Martin and Nick Eyles, we are pleased to announce the arrival of a new drone system for eco and geo spatial mapping and analysis. The EXPERT (EXPloring Environments in Real Time) Initiative is based on a DJI Matrice 300 RTK quadcopter drone, equipped with a GVI LiAir V 3-D LIDAR mapping system, and a MicaSense Altum multispectral sensor for terrain and ecological mapping. This now providesa cutting-edge ability to map large areas with a vertical resolution of ~5 cm and to now link physical substrates, such as changing geological conditions, with the natural and agricultural ecosystems that they support (such as forests and tree covers), including those in the built environment. This creates new opportunities for interdisciplinary research and training, and to begin modelling environmental change, such as vegetative responses to climate change etc., and modification of natural landscapes as urban areas expand. Details of the underlying land surface and its geology are also revealed in stunning detail.  </span><a href="lidar_2021_11_05.html">Read More</a>

    <span class="text">Recently, member of the lab set out to conduct some field work along Georgian Bay.  One of the stops was the Nottawasaga Lookout Trail just south of Collingwood. This site boasts a thick forest littered with dolostone blocks that are fractured and jointed (Figure 1-2). This reflects the site’s proximity to the Niagara Escarpment whose caprock is the notably resistant dolostone. If you have ever travelled across Central Ontario you have undoubtedly noticed the escarpment darting out up and above the relatively flat topography. The escarpment extends all the way from Lake Ontario to the tip of Bruce Peninsula boasting some of the most interesting sites that Ontario has to offer such as Niagara Falls or the Bruce Peninsula National Park. Stradling the escarpment is the renown Bruce Trail. The Nottawasaga Lookout Trail is one of the many segments of the Bruce Trail which extends across the entire extent of the Niagara Escarpment. </span><a href="Nottawasaga_2021_10_10.html">Read More</a>

This formation was created as the Taconic Mountains, which covered Ontario roughly 440 million years ago, were eroded and their sediments were subsequently deposited into coastal plains.

These are mainly attributed to the exposure of the Niagara Escarpment which extends from Lake Ontario up to and then along the eastern edge of the Bruce Peninsula. Some of the more interesting features are the sea caves and stacks that can be found throughout the Bruce Peninsula.  These represent a period in which the water levels in Georgian bay were much higher.  The features, now found a distance away from the present shoreline, provide evidence of past shorelines exposed the erosive processes of waves. </span><a href="BrucesCavesDevilsMonument_2021_10_13.html">Read More</a>
